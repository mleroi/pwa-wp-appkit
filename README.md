# pwa-wp-appkit
Progressive Web App made with [WP-AppKit's PWA export](https://github.com/mleroi/wp-app-kit/tree/feature-pwa).

Those are the sources of the PWA that runs here: [https://mleroi.github.io/pwa-wp-appkit/](https://mleroi.github.io/pwa-wp-appkit/). 

Open it on an Android device to really experiment the PWA features (add to home screen, offline capability etc). 

To test it directly in your desktop browser, use the mobile device emulation tool to enable touch events.
